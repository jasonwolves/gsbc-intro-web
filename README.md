# Jose Got The Answer Right
## The Official Site for the Jose App
<P> Jason Scott is a college student at Golden State Baptist College. He is a Pastoral Theology Major who grew up in Napa, California. Even though he grew up in church, it was at the age of five where he accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior. At the age of ten he was called to preach and from there his goal was set. He is a proud bus captain, and enjoys reading, playing ping-pong, and messing around with Photoshop and Coding in his free time. <P>

<P> Need to do: add websites that inspire me. <P>

<P> My idea and vision for this semester project is a contact and information page. I have an app that I have created *Jose Got The Answer Right* (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jose-got-the-answer-right/id1606467299) and I would like a way to set up a page about me where people could reach me regarding the app as well as a blog type set up where I can post sermons where people can read them and help them grow spiritually. Also if I have time during the class of after, I want to eventually set it up where people can reach out to me and order tracts that I have created. The idea that comes to mind is a layout where people can order them and have the order emailed to me so that I can then get the cards printed and shipped. <P>
 
<P> Add timeline for project <P>
