<P> Hello My name is Jason <P>
<P> My idea and vision for this semester project is a contact and information page. I have an app that I have created and I would like a way to set up a page about me where people could reach me to order cards that play the video that is featured on the app. <P>
<P> I would also potentially like to set it up with my email and social media so that they can contact me about the app and possibly a blog style where I can place sermons and the gospel in a consice format as the site evolves over time. <P>
