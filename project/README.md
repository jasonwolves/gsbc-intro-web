# Jose Got The Answer Right
## The Official Site for the Jose App
<P> Jason Scott is a college student at Golden State Baptist College. He is a Pastoral Theology Major who grew up in Napa, California. Even though he grew up in church, it was at the age of five where he accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior. At the age of ten he was called to preach and from there his goal was set. He is a proud bus captain, and enjoys reading, playing ping-pong, and messing around with Photoshop and Coding in his free time. <P>

<P> I can say with all sincerity that finding a website that inspired me was not a simple task; that was mostly becasue I had never really thought about it. I am very creative when it comes to the realm of tech and design but I have a very unique style that never feels like it fits anyone else. I definatly enjoy the bright colors that give it a bright feel. I also like the simplistic designs when it comes to a UI interface. A good example would be my home churches website or our website to the Jose cartoon that our church produces http://hopewellbc.com  and  https://gettheanswerright.com. I feel that it should be easy to get to where you want to go and easy to see where you are at. But making it simple does not mean that it must be dull looking. I like how Golden State Baptist College  www.gsbc.edu incorperates that balance between color and simplicity. I think that I pull my creativity from many avenues and that in turn makes me well versed to make whatever crazy idea my mind can come up with.  <P>

<P> My idea and vision for this semester project is a contact and information page. I have an app that I have created Jose Got The Answer Right (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jose-got-the-answer-right/id1606467299) and I would like a way to set up a page about me where people could reach me regarding the app as well as a blog type set up where I can post sermons where people can read them and help them grow spiritually. Also if I have time during the class of after, I want to eventually set it up where people can reach out to me and order tracts that I have created. The idea that comes to mind is a layout where people can order them and have the order emailed to me so that I can then get the cards printed and shipped. <P>
